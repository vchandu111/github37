add,commit and push

git add . => Stage 1 => Staging

git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"

git push origin <branchname>

Commiting

git status => check the status of our commit

git add . and git commit

After git commit => if you want to go back

git reset --soft HEAD1

git add .

Learning about git commands

1st clone => ft 37

2nd commit => Github Session
Staging to unstaging
git restore --staged filename

3rd commit => hard reset => 2nd commit
hard reset => 1st commit

4th commit => add,commit and push

git add . => Stage 1 => Staging

git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"

git push origin <branchname>

git push => update our changes to the Github

git pull =>

2 people => Cloned

Pushed to github

git pull => get the changes present in the Github repo but not in the local system

git checkout main

git merge <branchname>

git rebase
1st commit on main =>
branch feature => YOU are working

2nd commit and 3rd commits on main branch =>

git rebase => branch feature is created from 3rd commit => upto date with main
rewriting the branch history

linear commit history

less merge conflicts

Github Issues
creating tasks and assigning them to team members

How they are useful:

1. Tracking work => bugs, features, tasks, etc.
2. Communication and Collaboration
3. Project Management
4. Integrate with PR (Pull request)

Github Projects =>

Improved Organisation

Enhanced Collaboration

Flexibility

Integrate with other features

\*\*\* Software Development Life Cycle

structured approach to the development of applications

Application / Website

6 stages =>

1. Planning phase
   Define scope of project, resources, budget, timelines
   Create a detailed project plan
   Identify the risks and develop strategies to mitigate them

2. Requirement Gathering and Analysis
   Understand and document what software needs to do
   Engage with stakeholders to gather all requirements
   Analyze the feasibility of these requirements

3. Design Phase
   Create the solution
   Design both high-level and detailed components
   Create wireframes, data models, technical specifications

4. Implementation(Coding) Phase
   Convert design to actual code
   Developers write code for different modules/components
   Integrate all the modules together

5. Testing Phase
   Test the software => defetcs/bugs
   Software meets the required expectations

6. Deployment Phase
   Release software application to production
   Deployed for users

7. Maintenance and Support Phase
   provide maintenance and support
   fix any issues or bugs
   update or add more features

10 features in 30-35 days

STLC => Software Testing Life Cycle

defines the testing process

STLC is a subset of SDLC

1. Requirements Analysis
   Understand and analyze the testing requirements based on software

2. Test Planning
   Create a test plan => strategies, resources, scheduling and scope

3. Test Design
   Develop test cases and test scenarios based on the requirements and design

4. Test Environment Setup
   hardware, software, network configurations

5. Test Execution
   Running the tests and collecting results

6. Defect Reporting
   Document and report the defects, issues and results of testing

7. Test Closure
   Summarizing the test results and closure

Testing => bugs/defects

Seamless user flow, user experience, performance, speed of loading,

Purpose of Testing
Benefits of Testing

Manual and Automated

Manual Testing
login
Testers => website => login button => manually check the action/requirements
perform end-users actions => identify bugs/report the user flow

Automated Testing => Tools => repetitive tasks

1. Unit Testing =>
   Login button => button should be clickable
   on clicking, it has to redirect to login page

   Automated testing

2. Integration Testing =>
   Interaction between different software components and
   Chart JS library

3. System Testing =>
   Entire software suystem as a whole

4. Acceptance Testing =>
   Developed app is meeting the business requirements

5. Exploratory Testing =>
   Testers
